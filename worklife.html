          <hr />
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Despite the fact that my professional life began after graduating
            from college, my journey began much earlier. My journey started
            during my good old school days. That Chapter-16 Understanding HTML
            of computer science in 8th Standard in the school attracted me
            towards the World Wide Web. I still remember that
            <code>index.html</code> highlighting my name,
            <span class="text-secondary">Yanik Kumar</span>, inside a
            <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> bright yellow background made me feel
            like I painted my name on the web. With the early access to the
            internet, I used to surf the web with curiosity, looking through
            different websites. The vibrant colors and glowing text attracted
            me. <br />
            Back in those days during 11th-12th standard, I used to learn to do
            magic for fun and came across a few online stores selling magic
            items. Got more addicted to the web and e-commerce and was curious
            to know how things are made and sold online. Learned some tools to
            make videos and learned Photoshop as well to create images. During
            my college days, I expanded my skills to know more about e-commerce.
            I set up my first GoDaddy store with pure HTML and CSS design to
            sell something. Soon I realized it takes a lot to create an
            e-commerce platform. Learned more skills that got me here to this
            path. Let's get a little peek at my professional work life till now.

            In my college days, I attended workshops related to web design and
            development and started to learn full-stack development on my own. I
            wanted to completely understand the concept of how the actual web
            platforms work and how this online world works behind the scenes. My
            online presence started back in 2011 with my first Gmail account and
            Facebook account when it was uprising, and this online presence gave
            me so much, which helped me understand the online world. <br />
            I trained myself with digital marketing platforms in 2016 and
            started building something on my own. While learning full-stack
            development, I completed training in Complete Web Development at
            <span class="text-secondary">MCN Solutions Pvt. Ltd.</span>, where I
            gained extensive knowledge and experience. I also worked with
            <span class="text-secondary">PHPTPOINT</span>, contributing to
            content writing and assisting with several small projects. I built a
            few projects on my own and began working on my personal,
            close-to-heart project called
            <span class="text-secondary">Believe Master</span>. The training
            during college helped me gain strong web development skills and land
            my first internship as a frontend developer at
            <span class="text-info">Kingster636 Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</span> It
            was my first real exposure to the startup world and the spirit of
            <span class="text-secondary">"entrepreneurship"</span>, marking the
            start of my professional journey. I gained valuable experience
            through consistent effort — including failed but meaningful attempts
            — which taught me what not to do before starting anything.

            My 8th-semester internship was only halfway through when life took
            an unexpected turn—not just for me, but for all of us. I was still
            an undergraduate with my degree incomplete, and things didn’t go as
            planned. I started freelancing and continue learning new skills by
            building my own personal projects. That time I realized I was
            working on my personal project, Believe Master. I launched a news
            website—a multi-user writing platform designed for journalism
            students—which contributed to my high scores in the final semester.
            The news project shut down abruptly after a year due to some
            mistakes, which made me learn more. I started learning system design
            principles and delved deeper into the tech world.
            <br />
            Alongside, I kept on polishing my skills to be better day by day. My
            ISP started working on their project named
            <span class="text-info"
              >"Profile Baba - Local Service Provider"</span
            >
            which helped me implement all the things I hadn't implemented before
            starting the project. I gained some lazy experience and great ideas
            about starting a new project. Meanwhile, I started vlogging my life
            AGAIN. I gained more startup experience and learned a lot about
            entrepreneurship, finance, and the startup world—and read many books
            along the way. It was the greatest learning curve of my life. I
            tried many things for my professional life before deciding which
            path to choose to work toward my dreams. The lockdown phase taught
            me what to do before starting something.

            After completing my graduation in 2020, I decided to take a break
            from studies. I took online courses, attended workshops, and worked
            on various projects to enhance my knowledge and expertise in my
            field. During this period, I also explored different career options
            and gained clarity about my professional goals. I was already
            working with my ISP on their project Profile Baba to gain more
            experience and contribute, which helped me gain more experience in
            working as a solo developer and managing the project end-to-end. It
            was a great learning experience that helped me grow both personally
            and professionally. But I wanted to explore more opportunities and
            decided to look for a full-time job that aligns with my career
            goals. After a thorough job search, I found a position that matched
            my skills and aspirations perfectly. It was not a high-paying job,
            but it was a great opportunity to learn and grow in the way I
            wanted. I decided to take up the offer and started working there.
            This experience has been invaluable in shaping my career and helping
            me achieve my goals. I always wanted to work and contribute my
            skills in the Indian Government R&D Sector and finally got the
            opportunity to work with the

              >COI Project</a

            was by far my best work for the Research Organization—an experience
            I’ll never forget. It will always be remembered within the OSS team.

            Working with C-DOT was a great learning experience for me, but
            something shifted in my career progress. I have always wanted to
            contribute my technical skills to the Indian government’s R&D
            sector. The universe aligned me with my higher-self goals and
            aspirations, and in December 2022, I left C-DOT, New Delhi with so
            much learning, to join another government R&D organization,
